def main():
    # Your program will be written inside this custom function named main().
    #  All your code should be indented at least once from the left-margin
    #  of the screen. (So, your code's left margin should line up under the left
    #  margin of this comment, four spaces from the far left-margin.)

    # SECTION: Hardcoded data. Write your code below this comment.
    #  All data used in the program will appear at the beginning of the program
    #  Order ids will be hardcoded as string literals. There will be 5 of them.
    #  An order (list) will be hardcoded with order items (strings). An order 
    #   will contain 4 items.
    #  Menu will be hardcoded as order items (strings): prices (floats). 
    #   The menu will contain 8 items.
    #  Order items stored in the menu should match exactly (spelled the same) 
    #   the ones in an order.
    #  Orders will be a dictionary containing order ids(integers):orders (lists)



    # SECTION: Order Retrieval. Write your code below this comment.
    #  This section of code will display the order numbers and the first prompt.
    #  The order number will be saved to a variable.
    #  The specific order (a single list) will be retrieved 
    #  using the order number.


    # SECTION: Receipt Generation. Write your code below this comment.
    #  Using list indexes 0-3 will return each item in the order.
    #  Each item in the order will be used to retrieved the price from the menu 
    #   dictionary. Both will be printed.
    # Arithmetic will be used to calculate the total (variable).
    # Arithmetic will be used to calculate the 5% tax (variable)


    # SECTION: Tip Options. Write your code below this comment.
    #  The three percentages will be hardcoded: 15%, 20%, and 25% (strings to 
    #   display, floats for calculations).
    # All the rest of the tip data will be calculated using arithmetic based on 
    #  the tip percentage: tip amount (float), tip+total (float).



    # SECTION: Final Payment. Write your code below this comment.
    #  Prompt to ask which tip option to choose
    #  You have a couple of options here---options could be displayed as 
    #   a, b, c; and then a, b,c can be used as keys in the dictionary to return
    #   the actual percentage; or user could type in a number, and that number 
    #   could be used to calculate tip (it could even be used to calculate a 
    #   custom tip). 
    #  Will need to be sure to convert the input to an integer if number 
    #   option is used.



    # After you've written some code, delete the line of code under this comment
    #  that says 'pass'. It is just a placeholder to make sure the starter file 
    #  still compiles. You can delete this comment.
